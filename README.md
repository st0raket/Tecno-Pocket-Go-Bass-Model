# Immersive Gaming Innovation: Bass Diffusion Analysis

This repository contains the project files for analyzing the diffusion of the **Tecno Pocket Go** (a handheld gaming device) using the **Bass Diffusion Model**. We compare it to historical sales data from the **Nintendo Switch**, serving as our look-alike innovation.

## 1. Overview of Project

- **Goal**: Estimate Bass Model parameters (p, q, M) from Nintendo Switch sales data (2017â€“2024), then predict future adoption for the Tecno Pocket Go.
- **Why the Nintendo Switch?** It revolutionized handheld gaming, offering an analogous path for Tecno Pocket Go.
